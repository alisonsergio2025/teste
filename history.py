                text = "Between 2014 and 2016, global oil prices collapsed from over $100 per barrel to below $30 due to oversupply, especially from U.S. shale production, and OPEC's decision not to cut production. A slowdown in global demand, particularly from China, worsened the situation. This caused financial stress for oil-producing countries and companies, with many facing bankruptcies. In late 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC countries (OPEC+) agreed to cut production, leading to a gradual price recovery. By the end of 2016, prices started to stabilize above $50 per barrel."

                text = "The Brent Crude oil crisis of 2020 was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically reduced global oil demand. In March, a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia caused oil prices to plummet. By April, oil prices briefly dropped below $20 per barrel, and the WTI benchmark even went negative. In response, OPEC+ agreed to historic production cuts. Oil prices slowly recovered through the second half of 2020, but the market remained volatile."

                text = "In 2022, oil prices surged due to the Russia-Ukraine war, which disrupted global oil supplies and led to sanctions on Russian oil exports. Ongoing production cuts by OPEC+ and post-pandemic demand recovery also strained supply, pushing prices higher. Inflation and market speculation further contributed to the rally. By mid-year, Brent Crude prices hit around $120 per barrel. The combination of geopolitical tensions and supply-demand imbalances fueled the price increase."
